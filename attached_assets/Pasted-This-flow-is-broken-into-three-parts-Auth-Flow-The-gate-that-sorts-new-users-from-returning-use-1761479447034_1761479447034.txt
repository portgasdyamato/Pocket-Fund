This flow is broken into three parts:

Auth Flow: The "gate" that sorts new users from returning users.

New User "Bootcamp" Flow: The one-time setup and connecting process.

Logged-In App Flow: The main app structure with its navbar and pages.

1. Auth Flow (The "Gate")
This flow begins when a user clicks [Start the Fight] on your Framer page and is redirected to your app (e.g., app.yourdomain.com).

Page: app.yourdomain.com/auth

Purpose: The single entry point for all users.

UI: Shows a clean modal with the "Glow-Up" logo.

Headline: "Let's get this bread."

Primary CTA: [G] Continue with Google

(Optional: "Or sign up with email")

Small Text: "By continuing, you agree to our Terms of Service."

User Action: Clicks [G] Continue with Google.

Backend Logic:

User authenticates with Google.

The app receives the user's details (email, name).

Database Check: "Does this email exist in our users table?"

IF NO (New User):

Create a new user record (e.g., user_id: 123, email: ..., onboarding_status: 'step_1').

Redirect to: app.yourdomain.com/bootcamp/step-1

IF YES (Returning User):

Fetch the user's record.

Check their onboarding_status.

IF status is NOT 'complete': Redirect them to the step they left off (e.g., .../bootcamp/step-3).

IF status IS 'complete':

Create a secure session.

Redirect to: app.yourdomain.com/hq
